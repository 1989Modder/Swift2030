This was effective, and Red states rallied behind him, promising to resist the \"illegitimate\" president. This worked for weeks, until Trump died of a heart attack at the age of 83, in a room with only Tucker Carlson and his son, Donald Trump Jr. Each claims he named them as his succesor on his deathbed.</p>\n\n<p>Facing pressure from both the MAGA base and Swift's federal government, the divided Republicans signed the treaty of Ann Arbor, dividing the United States into two nations under an economic union. Premier Swift, under a new parliamentary constitution, promises to start fresh. She has called a snap election and is challenged by those who would propose a return to the old constitution.</p>",

However, Swift did not create the unity she expected, simply a new divisions. She will be forced to convince Americans that the recent economic and political chaos was worth it, and that she can lead the ADN ahead without the Red States.

Nevertheless, Hassan endorses a general return to the old US constitution, if not as firmly as the New Democrats. Hassan is expected to lean heavily on the legacy of the Union in the first Civil War,  while advocating to start a second.
